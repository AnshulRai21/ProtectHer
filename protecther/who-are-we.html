                    At <strong>ProtectHer</strong>, we are more than just a tech-driven safety platform — we are a movement for change, dedicated to creating a world where every woman feels secure and empowered. We recognize that safety is not just a need but a right, and our mission is to safeguard that right by providing cutting-edge, easy-to-use tools designed to prevent and respond to threats in real time.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                    Our journey began with a singular vision: to bridge the gap between technology and women’s safety. From a small, passionate team of developers and activists, we have grown into a global network of innovators, advocates, and experts from diverse fields. We collaborate closely with law enforcement agencies, social workers, mental health professionals, and survivors of violence to ensure that our solutions address real-world challenges.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                    We believe in proactive safety. By integrating AI, real-time GPS tracking, and user-friendly emergency features, our app helps women take control of their personal security while staying connected to their loved ones. Our platform also offers education and resources, from self-defense training to personal safety tips, because we know that prevention is as crucial as protection.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    ProtectHer isn’t just about responding to emergencies — it's about reshaping how society views women’s safety. We aim to create safe spaces, build community awareness, and use data-driven insights to inform policies that make our communities safer for everyone.
